## Table Of Contents

1. `Proto_glouton_python`: first prototype in order to build a cutting pattern on a simplified problem without optimization
2. `Proto_sprint_python`: Second prototype used to build the solutions submitted for the sprint phase (23th of May 2018). 
A Jupyter Notebook explains step by step how the solutions are built considering all the constraints.
3. `Proto_industriel_python`: This prototype is a transposition from the Jupyter Notebook to a Python project which was used to test how the constructive algorithm could work.
4. `Code_cpp_old`: This is the programm used for the Qualification phase, the structure is very close to the `Proto_industriel_python`. It's a CMake project.
5 `Code_cpp`: This is the programm used for the Final Phase, it takes the good ideas from the previous code but the entire structure changed.
6. `Codes_auxiliaires_pythons`: Two small programms to draw and to check a solution. The solution drawn may not be cutting tree pattern, it's only rectangles with coordinates. 
7. `checker_instances`: Checker, visualizer and instances (made by organizers of the challenge)
8. `Documents`: 
>  * A short description (2 pages) of the algorithm used for the Qualification Phase
>  * A description (5 pages) of the algorithm used for the Final Phase
